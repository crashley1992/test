            <p>This app is a Comic Hero Finder. A user should be able to type a comic hero's name and information about them will display. Some features in the works will allow users to save and look up comics associated with a hero.</p>

            <h5><strong>Why choose React?</strong></h5>
            <p>A previous version of this project was made using jQuery. Nothing against jQuery, but it felt like code was getting repetitive in certain parts of the project such as the results display. React seemed like a better choice for scalability,readability, and overall maintenance of the project. This is especially true as new features are added.</p>
            <h5><strong>Why choose MongoDB?</strong></h5>
            <p>Flexibility! Since new features are being added to the project, MongoDB is really easy to configure and organize without having to worry about complex object-relational mapping(ORM). Additionally, there are cloud features such as MongoDB Atlas that allows for more secure storage of data.</p>
            <h5><strong>Why choose Node?</strong></h5>
            <p>Node with Express makes creating routes and using 3rd APIs easy. Use of NPM packages make it simpler to use multiple tools and modules. Additionally, an app can be built using only JavaScript, which did not require me learning another language.</p>
